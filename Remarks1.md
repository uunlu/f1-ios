# Formula 1 App Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction
This document outlines detailed requirements for enhancing a Formula 1 statistics app. These guidelines should be implemented precisely, following best iOS development practices and design patterns.

## User Interface Requirements

### Loading States
1. **Consistent Loading View**
   - Implement a unified loading view component to be used across the app
   - Display this loader during initial app launch
   - Show the same loader when viewing season details while data is being fetched
   - Consider implementing skeleton UI for improved perceived performance

2. **Splash Screen**
   - Add a professional splash screen with the app logo
   - Purpose: Mask initial loading time while app resources initialize
   - Should automatically transition to main content when loading completes

### Error & Empty States
1. **Race Winners Empty State**
   - When no race winners are found for a season, display a clear message
   - Example message: "No race winners found for this season"
   - Include a visual indicator (icon) to enhance the message
   - Ensure proper alignment and styling consistent with the app

### Pull-to-Refresh
1. **Implement Auto-Reload Functionality**
   - Add pull-to-refresh capability to both season list and race winners views
   - On pull-to-refresh, bypass local cache and use remote loaders directly
   - Show appropriate loading indicator during refresh
   - Update "Last Updated" timestamp after successful refresh

### Navigation
1. **Fix Navigation Title**
   - Change back button text from "Back" to "Seasons" when viewing season details
   - Ensure consistent navigation title styling throughout the app

### UI Enhancements
1. **Last Updated Indicator**
   - Add a "Last Updated" timestamp on screens with dynamic data
   - Format: "Last updated: [date] [time]"
   - Update this timestamp whenever fresh data is loaded

## Data Management Architecture

### Local Data Storage
1. **LocalRaceWinnerLoader**
   - Create a component responsible for loading race winner data from local storage
   - Follow repository pattern with a clear protocol
   - Implement error handling for data corruption/missing data scenarios

2. **LocalSeasonLoader**
   - Create a component responsible for loading season data from local storage
   - Follow the same pattern as LocalRaceWinnerLoader for consistency
   - Add appropriate error types and handling

### Remote Data Fetching
1. **RemoteRaceWinnerLoader**
   - Implement component to fetch race winner data from remote API
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Parse and validate response data

2. **RemoteSeasonLoader**
   - Implement component to fetch season data from remote API
   - Follow the same pattern as RemoteRaceWinnerLoader for consistency

### Decorator Pattern Implementation
1. **LocalWithRemoteRaceWinnerLoader**
   - Create decorator that first attempts to load from local storage
   - If local data is missing or invalidated, fall back to remote loading
   - After successful remote load, update local cache
   - Implement the same protocol as individual loaders

2. **LocalWithRemoteSeasonLoader**
   - Follow same pattern as the race winner loader decorator
   - Ensure proper protocol conformance for interoperability

### Cache Invalidation Strategy
1. **Modular Invalidation Approach**
   - Design a protocol-based cache invalidation strategy
   - Support multiple invalidation policies:
     - Time-based (e.g., expire after 1 hour)
     - Version-based (e.g., invalidate when data schema changes)
     - Manual invalidation (e.g., force refresh)
   - Make strategies easily swappable and customizable
   - Use dependency injection for testing

## Development Requirements

### Localization
1. **Multi-language Support**
   - Implement localization for English and German languages
   - Extract all user-facing strings to Localizable.strings files
   - Use SwiftGen or similar tool to generate type-safe string constants
   - Ensure date/time formats respect locale settings

### Code Quality
1. **SwiftLint Integration**
   - Add SwiftLint to the project with appropriate rule set
   - Configure rules to enforce Swift style guidelines
   - Add lint step to CI/CD pipeline if applicable

2. **Code Clarity**
   - Remove all unnecessary code comments
   - Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive naming
   - Use meaningful variable, function, and class names
   - Only add comments for complex algorithms or non-obvious solutions

### Testing
1. **Unit Testing Requirements**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all loader components
   - Test cache invalidation strategies separately
   - Use mock objects and dependency injection to isolate components
   - Aim for high test coverage of business logic
   - Include tests for error cases and edge conditions

## Implementation Notes

1. **Pull-to-Refresh Behavior**
   - When user manually refreshes via pull gesture, always fetch from remote
   - Bypass the decorator pattern in this specific case
   - Update local cache with fetched data

2. **Loading Priority**
   - Prioritize showing some UI as quickly as possible
   - Load from cache immediately while fetching fresh data in background
   - Update UI when fresh data arrives

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed network requests
   - Show appropriate error messages with retry options
   - Fall back to cached data when possible

## Technical Approach

1. **Follow SOLID principles**
   - Single Responsibility: Each loader has one job
   - Open/Closed: Extend functionality through decorators without modifying existing code
   - Liskov Substitution: All loaders follow the same protocol
   - Interface Segregation: Use focused protocols
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

2. **Use Protocol-Oriented Programming**
   - Define clear interfaces for loaders and cache strategies
   - Enable easy mocking for testing

3. **Implement Proper Memory Management**
   - Consider memory implications of caching strategies
   - Implement proper cleanup of resources
   - Use weak references where appropriate

By implementing these requirements, the Formula 1 app will provide a better user experience with improved performance, reliability, and maintainability. The architecture will support future enhancements while maintaining a solid foundation of best practices.
